**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I was only given information for desktop screens at 1280px, and mobile screens at 320px, but I included an option for tablets at 800-768px.

I optimized the png images through the provided website.

**Video Explanation**

Here is a link to the video explanation of my project. I am still getting usedd to the proper terms to individual elements and properties in coding. So excuse me if I stumble around a bit during the video, I know that I will continue to improve and will have the terms down properly in no time!

**Final Thoughts**

This sprint was very challenging as there was a lot of information to take in and process. It was a little overwhelming coming into the sprint with much less direction than the previous sprints, and I thought it was going to be more of a struggle than it turned out to be. I feel so much better and more confident in my abilities now that I've finished this sprint and I feel like I'm grasping the concepts much better than before! I also liked that I was given the opportunity to use the figma desgin and the limited direction to code on my own and problem solve as I worked through the project. Once I had finished it all on my own I watched the provided videos of the tutor doing the project and it helped clear up a lot of confusion around certain aspects of the project.

All in all, I feel excited to finish this sprint and look forward to the feedback and to learn how I can be better and more efficient in my coding!

I hope I didn't make any big mistakes but I am ready to learn from any if I did! Bring it on!
