**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I was only given information for desktop screens at 1280px, and mobile screens at 320px, but I made adjustments so it would be responsive to most screen displays. Used javascript to add functionality to it, with smooth modal open/close transitions by using classList "open**modal and open**preview-modal".

Refactored according to OOP principles.
