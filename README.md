**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I was only given information for desktop screens at 1280px, and mobile screens at 320px, but I made adjustments so it would be responsive to most screen displays. Used javascript to add functionality to it, with smooth modal open/close transitions by using classList "open**modal and open**preview-modal".

**Final Thoughts**

I feel like the site is coming together very well. All the buttons are functioning correctly, and there are no scroll bars or obstructions at any screen sizes that I've found. The modals all work as they should, and I believe I've stayed true to structuring my code according to BEM as well as keeping my code clean and organized.
